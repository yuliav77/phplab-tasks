        Filtering task #1

        i.e. /?filter_by_first_letter=A or /?filter_by_first_letter=B

        Make sure, that the logic below also works:
         - when you apply filter_by_first_letter the page should be equal 1
         - when you apply filter_by_first_letter, than filter_by_state (see Filtering task #2) is not reset
